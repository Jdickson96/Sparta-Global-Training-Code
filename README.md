# Sparta Global Training Code
Code created during the sparta global training program

## Hello World
This was a Hello world at one point but I have changed it because I don't think a Hello World file is worth saving. It is currently a piece of code that I am working on in my free time to practice C#. I will add further details when I add more to the code.

## Time Of Day NUnit Testing


## Test First Programming Excersize
This code was a list of short coding tests:
* Greater than or equal to code
* BODMAS Test (number treated with a series of maths operators)
* Return true when an input number is even
* Sum all even numbers and multiples of 5 up to a number n
* Return true if input is "password"
* Return Sum of all numbers in a list

### Greater than or Equal to
Its just:
```csharp
if (x >= y)  { return true; }
        else { return false;}
```
