## Introduction
Object Oriented Programming was developed to replace the previous procedural programming structure that had been in place. This is due to weaknesses in this coding setup steming from the practice of having code and data in seperate locations within the program. By having these seperate, it leads to several key issues:

* Lacking Modularity
* High Levels of coupling between values and its code counterpart
* Re-using code is difficult
* It doesn't model real world systems

Instead of this procedural method OOP systems combine the data with the code acting upon it in units called `classes`. OOP as a format now dominates the prominant coding languages used today (with 4/5 of the main languages being OOP in design). This is due to its key benefits:

* It's Data and Functions are combined
* Better Modularity
* Low levels of Coupling
* Re-Use of code is much easier
* It Models the real world

### 4 Principles of OOP
These key principles which define if a language can be called an OOP language or not are:
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

#### Abstraction
